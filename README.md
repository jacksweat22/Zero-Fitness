## <h3> How to Start </h3>
To start, one MUST create an account to access the unique features Zer0 has to offer! Once logged in the user can create, update, an delete user generated exercises.

## <h5>Next Step</h5>
My first priority is to fix my Auth issue. While the whole app worked wihtout aut, an Auth is coded just like the mark down, it wont submit. So, I will be fixing that as soon as I can! My next goal is to create the next functionality which would let users scheudele workouts with trianers at their local gyms, or get in tough for tips about wokrouts
